abstract: The invention belongs to the field of low-power consumption Bluetooth technology in wireless communication, in particular to a method for improving the sensitivity of the receiver in a low-power consumption Bluetooth system. The method of the invention is to introduce a deinterleaver between the symbol pattern mapper and GFSK modulator of the transmitting terminal under the low-power consumption Bluetooth coding mode, which is used to perform additional processing on the bitstream data and then perform modulation; then, due to the introduction of interleaving, Turbo iterative processing of demodulation and decoding can be performed at the receiving terminal; the receiving terminal comprises a Turbo iterative demodulator and decoder, which is used to model the low-power consumption Bluetooth GFSK modulator and convolutional coder into finite state machines, and then combine the deinterleaver to use the BCJR algorithm for iterative demodulation and decoding.
